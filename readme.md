## Changing files and committing those changes.

1. Use a [text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor) to add `Manfred Delmonte` to a new line in `files/employees.txt` and `Peaches` to a new line in `files/products.txt`.
1. Stage the changes that you made to the files. Use the `git status` command to check that you have staged all of your changes.
1. Commit your staged changes using the commit message "Add Manfred and Peaches". 

## Pushing

If you have your own repository containing this exercise (e.g. a fork) then you can push the changes you made.
